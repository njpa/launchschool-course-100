# Loops and Iterators

* Loop: the repetitive execution of a piece of code until a specified condition is met.
* While loop:  a loop that is given a parameter that evaluates to a boolean.  Once the parameter evaluates to `false`, the loop stops executing.
* Do/while loop:  a loop that has the conditional check at the end of the loop and not at the beginning (handy for situations in which a check is needed in order to proceed executing the loop, but there is a need to run the loop at least once no matter the conditions.
* For loop:  used to collect over a collection of elements.  Differs from while loops, do/while loops and loops in that it returns the collection of elements as it loops as opposed to `nil`.
