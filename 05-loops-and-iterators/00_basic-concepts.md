# Loops and Iterators

* Loop: the repetitive execution of a piece of code until a specified condition is met.
* While loop:  a loop that is given a parameter that evaluates to a boolean.  Once the parameter evaluates to `false`, the loop stops executing.
* Do/while loop:  a loop that has the conditional check at the end of the loop and not at the beginning (handy for situations in which a check is needed in order to proceed executing the loop, but there is a need to run the loop at least once no matter the conditions.
* For loop:  used to collect over a collection of elements.  Differs from while loops, do/while loops and loops in that it returns the collection of elements as it loops as opposed to `nil`.

* Iterators: methods that iterate over a set of data and allow you to operate on each element in that collection.
* Block: lines of code ready to be executed.  
* Next:  placing the `next` reserved word in a loop makes the execution jump to the next iteration without executing the code beneath it.
* Break:  placing the `break` reserved word in a loop will exit the loop immediately without executing any more code.
* Recursion:  the act of calling a method from within itself.  The key concept behind recursion is that there is a baseline condition which returns a value which then unwindes the recursive call.  
* Fibonacci sequence:  a sequence of integers in which every number after the first two is the sum of the preceding ones.
