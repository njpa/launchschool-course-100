# Methods

* Method:  a piece of code that needs to be executed many times in a program.
* Arguments: pieces of information sent to a method invocation to be modified or used to return a specific result.
* Parameter: used to receive information from outside of the method's definition scope.
* Default parameters: can be assigned in case the method call does not send in any arguments.
* Mutating the caller: when we alter the argument in a method invocation permanently. 
* Returns:  every method implicitly returns the result of the evaulation of the last expression that is executed (unless an explicit return comes before it).
