# EXERCISE 11
# ===========
# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# ANSWER
# ======
# I like ruby-doc.org for the following features:
# - anchoring targets on each method
# - thorough set of examples for each method
# However, I don't think the search function is all that useful.

# I also like `devdocs.io` because it has a useful autocomplete 
# field which lets me find classes quite fast.  
# The dark theme option is also nice.  
# In general, I prefer to use `ruby-doc.org` as I find it easier to read 
# (from a typography viewpoint).

# docs.ruby-lang.org comes is also pretty good.  I find the font makes it hard to read on my browser compared to ruby-doc.org.   The autocomplete text field at the top makes it easy for me to jump from class to class.

# A couple of wierd ones are: apidock.com/ruby 

# The ideal documentation for me would freeze the left pane 
# containing a list of the methods allowing you to scroll 
# freely through the right pane containing a thorough 
# description of the methods along with examples 
# whilst keeping visible the navigation.  
# Some dynamic 
# I find that the documentation for Elixir 
# language is very good in that sense 
# (https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Kernel.html).
