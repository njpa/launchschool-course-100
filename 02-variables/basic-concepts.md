# Variables

* __variable__:  used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
* __variable scope__: determines where in a program a variable is available for use. * __inner scope__: can access variables initialized in the outer scope.
* __outer scope__: variables initialized inside of a method invocation are not available to the outer scope.
* __types of variables__:
  * Constant variables:  Ideally unmutable although possible to change.  Cannot be declared in method definitions and available throughout the application's scope.
  * Global variables: overrides all scope boundaries and is available throughout the entire application. Prececed by a `$`.
  * Class variables: accessible by all instances of a class.  Preceded by `@@`.
  * Instance variables:  accessible throughout the entire current instance of the parent class.  Preceded by a `@`.
  * Local variables:  obey all scope boundaries.
