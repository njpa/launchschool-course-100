# Flow Control

* Conditional flow: the path given to data in a program with the aim having the data do the right thing when it's supposed to.
* Conditionals: once data arrives at a conditional, the conditional then tells the data where to go based on some defined parameters.  They are formed by a combination of `if` statements and comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, ||, &&, !=).
